      <h5>What is React?</h5>
      <p>
        React.js, more commonly known as React, is a free, open-source
        JavaScript library. It works best to build user interfaces by combining
        sections of code (components) into full websites. <br />
        Originally built by Facebook, Meta and the open-source community now
        maintain it. One of the good things about React is that you can use it
        as much or as little as you want! <br />
        For example, you can build your entire site in React or just use one
        single React component on one page.
